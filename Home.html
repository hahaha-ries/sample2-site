Bening, currently on my first year in the program Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, section 1 - A. <br/>I like writing stories as a pass time hobby and one of the hardest thing I had encountered <br/>was putting my ideas into words as well as getting into the mood of writing, and reading various genres of books and ebooks helped me a lot. <br/>I got motivated and energized, and I personally admire poets because of their writing styles, hoping one day I'll find mine too. <br/>One of the poems which I like the most and had been stucked in my mind is Mr . Juan Ramon Jimenez's "I am not I":</b></p>
		<h3 style = "color:black;" align = "center"> <i><b><br/>"I am not I.
             <br/>I am this one
<br/>walking beside me whom I do not see,
<br/>whom at times I manage to visit,
<br/>and whom at other times I forget;
<br/>the one who remains calm and silent while I talk,
<br/>and forgives, gently, when I hate,
<br/>who walks where I am not,
<br/>who will remain standing when I die."</b></i></h3>
